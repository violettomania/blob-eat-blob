## Blob Eat Blob

A simple game (very) loosely based on Katamari Damacy I built for practicing JavaScript modularization, using HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript and Webpack.

To try, make sure you have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed, then:

1. navigate to the project folder

2. `npm install webpack --save-dev`

3. `npm run build`

4. open `board.html`

Use numpad keys to move in 8 directions. Your goal is to avoid the bigger blobs and eat the smaller ones, until you become the Super Blob!
You can tackle blobs of your size as well, but watch out: the result can be ambiguous.
